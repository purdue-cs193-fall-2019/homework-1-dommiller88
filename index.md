# Dom's First CS193 Homework

This is my first assignment for cs193! I hope you like it.  I sure love it.  Today I was almost late to this class but luckily I was not. Now I am in the back of the classroom typing this.  That was a really good story, I know. If you like, I can tell it again in person. Regardless, this is my website.

## Some things that I like about CS:
- Figuring out solutions to problems
- Meeting New Friends
- Working on my Computer
