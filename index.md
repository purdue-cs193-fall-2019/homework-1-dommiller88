## Welcome to Dom's Website

This is my first assignment for cs193! I hope you like it.  I sure love it.  Today I was almost late to this class but luckily I was not. Now I am in the back of the classroom typing this.  That was a really good story, I know. If you like, I can tell it again in person. Regardless, this is my website.



### List
I made a list of all the colors I know.

- Magenta

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/kalutes/CS193_Fall18_Lab1/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
